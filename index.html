            Be conscious of Allah and know that the ordainments of Islam revolve around striving against oneself and striving among people. Both strivings take up one’s entire life, moment by moment. The fact that one spends one’s entire time in both strivings is a well-known fact from the life of the Chosen One ﷺ. Whenever he ﷺrested from striving against disbelief in one corner of the earth, he then moved on to another corner, filling it with faith and piety. The Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, proceeded after him, leaving no room for idleness, and they filled the corners of the earth with the illumination of faith.<br>
            Nothing will rectify the state of this Ummah except that which rectified its earliest generations, and that is by following the path of the righteous predecessors in their concern for time and in valuing it properly.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">10/30/2025 The Rank of Muhammad ﷺ</p><div style="float:right;"><img src="img3.jpg" width="200"></div>
            Allah is the ONLY one perfect and everything else has some form of deficiency (i.e -death).<br>

            Prophets are the best and specially chosen people but they get hungry, get tried, get emotional, get stressed and can have normal human limitations, except in issues related to heavenly message.<br>

            The fact that Allaah has commanded us to follow the Messengers and take them as our example. The prophet (saw) must be loved, respected, and obeyed. It does not require any discussion for Muslims. He is the final authority in Islam.
